### Quasi-Inverse Convection Code

# QuICC is a simulation framework for solving the Navier-Stokes equations in spherical, cylindrical and Cartesian geometry.

## Features:

   - Fully spectral using Fourier, Chebyshev, Worland and Associated Legendre basis
   - Multiple geometries: spherical shell, full sphere, cylinder, plane layer, cartesian box
   - Sparse formulation of the linear operators
   - High-level Python interface for the linear operators
   - Nonlinear simulations
   - Linear stability calculations using PETSc/SLEPc
   - 1D, 2D and 2.5D parallelisation
